# Data Visualisation using Python

This project showcases data visualization techniques using some of the most widely used Python libraries: pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. It provides an overview of the dataset, explores relationships between key variables, and includes insightful plots that support data analysis. The main goal is to demonstrate my proficiency in visualizing data using Python.

The dataset utilized is the "tips" dataset, which is readily available through the seaborn library. It contains information related to customer tips and demographic details of the tippers.

Specifically, the project includes:

- An overview of the "tips" dataset
- Visualizations exploring relationships between various features
- Plots that highlight meaningful insights within the data
- A correlation matrix illustrating relationships between all numerical variables
